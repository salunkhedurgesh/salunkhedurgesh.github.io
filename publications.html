            A cuspidal serial robot can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without crossing a
            singularity. Cuspidal robots ask for extra care and caution in trajectory planning, as identifying an aspect
            related to one unique inverse kinematic solution is not possible. The issues related to motion planning with
            cuspidal robots are related to the inherent property arising from the geometric design of the robot. The
            cuspidality property has not been considered in recent industrial 6R robots with a non-spherical wrist. In
            this work, cuspidality is illustrated with the JACO robot (gen 2, non-spherical wrist), a serial arm by
            Kinova Robotics which is  deployed in various applications and is cuspidal in nature. A nonsingular change
            of solutions for the robot is provided to highlight the effect of cuspidal robots on the interference with
            the environment. The pose with multiple inverse kinematic solutions in an aspect is presented.
            Problems in choosing the initial solution of the path in cuspidal robots, and its consequence, is
            illustrated with an example path in the workspace of the JACO robot. The paper presents the importance of
            cuspidality analysis of 6R robots and the implications of neglecting it.

            Cuspidal robots are robots with at least two inverse kinematic solutions that can be connected by a
            singularity-free path. Deciding the cuspidality of generic 3R robots has been studied in the past, but
            extending the study to six-degree-of-freedom robots can be a challenging problem. Many robots can be modeled
            as a polynomial map together with a real algebraic set so that the notion of cuspidality can be extended to
            these data. In this paper we design an algorithm that, on input a polynomial map in n indeterminates, and s
            polynomials in the same indeterminates describing a real algebraic set of dimension d, decides the
            cuspidality of the restriction of the map to the real algebraic set under consideration. Moreover, if D and
            <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&#964</span> are, respectively the maximum degree and the
            bound on the bit size of the coefficients of the input polynomials, this algorithm runs in time log-linear
            in <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&#964</span> and polynomial in ((s+d)D)O(n2). It
            relies on many high-level algorithms in computer algebra which use advanced methods on real algebraic sets
            and critical loci of polynomial maps. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm that tackles the
            cuspidality problem from a general point of view.

            Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution (IKS) to another without meeting a
            singularity. This property can be analyzed by understanding the inverse kinematic model (IKM) as well as the
            singularities in the joint space and in the workspace. In this article, we revisit the geometrical
            interpretation of the IKM with conics. The conditions of getting different conics and their implication on
            singularities are discussed and the observations regarding the nature of the conics are presented. Further,
            a sufficient condition for a 3R robot to be binary (i.e. with up to 2 IKS) as well as quaternary (i.e. with
            up to 4 IKS) is put forth by analyzing the geometrical interpretation of the IKM. The possibility to derive
            a necessary and sufficient condition is presented too.

            Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without meeting a singularity.
            The name cuspidal was coined based on the existence of a cusp point in the workspace of 3R serial robots.
            The existence of a cusp point was proved to be a necessary and sufficient condition for orthogonal robots
            to be cuspidal, but it was not possible to extend this condition to non-orthogonal robots. The goal of this
            paper is to prove that this condition stands for any generic 3R serial robot. This result would give the
            designer more flexibility. In the presented work, the geometrical interpretation of the inverse kinematics
            of 3R robots is revisited and important observations on the nonsingular change of posture are noted. The
            paper presents a theorem regarding the existence of reduced aspects in any generic 3R serial robot. Based
            on these observations and on this theorem, we prove that the existence of a cusp point is a necessary and
            sufficient condition for any 3R generic robot to be cuspidal.

            The optimization of parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) involve several constraints that are difficult to
            formalize, thus making optimal synthesis problem highly challenging. The presence of passive joint limits as
            well as the singularities and self-collisions lead to a complicated relation between the input and output
            parameters. In this article, a novel optimization methodology is proposed by combining a local search,
            Nelder–Mead algorithm, with global search methodologies such as low discrepancy distribution for faster and
            more efficient exploration of the optimization space. The effect of the dimension of the optimization
            problem and the different constraints are discussed to highlight the complexities of closed-loop kinematic
            chain optimization. The work also presents the approaches used to consider constraints for passive joint
            boundaries as well as singularities to avoid internal collisions in such mechanisms. The proposed algorithm
            can also optimize the length of the prismatic actuators and the constraints can be added in modular fashion,
            allowing to understand the impact of given criteria on the final result. The application of the presented
            approach is used to optimize two PKMs of different degrees of freedom.

            In otolaryngologic surgery, more and more robots are being studied to meet the clinical needs of operating
            rooms. However, to help design and optimize these robots, the workspace must be precisely defined taking
            into account patient variability. The aim of this work is to define a geometric atlas of the middle ear and
            paranasal sinuses for endoscopic robotic applications. Scans of several patients of different ages and sexes
            were used to determine the average size of these workspaces, which are linked by the similar use of
            endoscopes in surgery.

            The use of an endoscope in otological surgery as compared to using a microscope provides many benefits in
            terms of visibility and access to the operating region. The disadvantage of using an endoscope is that it
            has to be handled by the surgeon during the surgery. A novel parallel kinematic mechanism has been proposed
            recently for manipulating the endoscope during surgery. This paper details the design requirements
            considered for the optimization of the process, after consulting surgeons with various expertise.
            The paper further presents the different evaluation strategies that can be used to optimize the design
            parameters as per the needs of the application. The contribution of the presented work is the implementation
            of the surgeons’ requirements into an objective function and the optimization of a proposed architecture of
            a parallel kinematic mechanism suitable for otological surgery.

            In otolaryngologic surgery, endoscopy is increasingly used to provide a better view of hard-to-reach areas
            and to promote minimally invasive surgery. However, the need to manipulate the endoscope limits the
            surgeon's ability to operate with only one instrument at a time. Currently, several robotic systems are
            being developed, demonstrating the value of robotic assistance in microsurgery. The aim of this literature
            review is to present and classify current robotic systems that are used for otological and endonasal
            applications. For these solutions, an analysis of the functionalities in relation to the surgeon's needs
            will be carried out to produce a set of specifications for the creation of new robots.

            In otolaryngologic surgery, endoscopy is increasingly used to provide a better view of hard-to-reach areas
            and to promote minimally invasive surgery. However, the need to manipulate the endoscope limits the
            surgeon's ability to operate with only one instrument at a time. Currently, several robotic systems are
            being developed, demonstrating the value of robotic assistance in microsurgery. The aim of this literature
            review is to present and classify current robotic systems that are used for otological and endonasal
            applications. For these solutions, an analysis of the functionalities in relation to the surgeon's needs
            will be carried out to produce a set of specifications for the creation of new robots.

            In this paper, a kinematic motion planning algorithm for cooperative spatial payload manipulation is
            presented. A hierarchical approach is introduced to compute realtime collision-free motion plans for a
            formation of mobile manipulator robots. Initially, collision-free configurations of a deformable 2-D virtual
            bounding box are identified, over a planning horizon, to determine a convex workspace for the entire system.
            Then, 3-D payload configurations whose projections lie within the convex workspace are computed. Finally, a
            convex decentralized model-predictive controller is formulated to plan collision-free trajectories for the
            formation of mobile manipulators. Our work facilitates real-time motion planning for the system and is
            scalable in the number of robots. The algorithm is validated in simulated dynamic environments.

            Parallel manipulators are being used extensively to cater to the needs of a multitude of industrial
            automation applications. Due to its kinematic accuracy and structural stiffness, parallel manipulators have
            proven considerable advantage over their serial counterparts. In modern applications, humans train,
            collaborate and interact with the manipulators in order to maximize the productivity and the quality of the
            final product. The critical factor in this human-robot interaction is safety and the ability of the
            mechanism to comply with human intentions. It thus becomes a necessity for the manipulator to detect
            external disturbances and interactions, and be able to react accordingly. In this research, a methodology
            for sensor-less full body active compliance is proposed on a 6-DOF RSS (Rotary-Spherical-Spherical) parallel
            manipulator. By using the proposed approach, the manipulator can detect and comply with the external forces
            on any part of its body without using any explicit force/torque sensor at the joint or the end-effector.
            This is done by utilizing the estimated joint torque based on the actuator current feedback only. A
            three-layer cascaded impedance controller for active compliance and reaction to various human interactions
            are reported. The proposed design and unique methodology for compliance exhibits an effective and
            inexpensive yet reliable alternative to be used in safe human-robot interactions and force controlled
            manufacturing applications.

            Parallel manipulators are widely used in the industries for several applications. Due to its precision in
            motion as well as its robustness, parallel manipulators have proved its advantage over serial manipulators.
            In this paper, a 3DOF parallel manipulator is presented and force control of the manipulator is
            demonstrated. The proposed manipulator uses a direct drive voice coil arc actuators to achieve compliance
            required for human-robot interaction or soft mechanical manipulations. Its implementation in the proposed
            delta manipulator is discussed in the paper. The paper has discussed a unique method of controlling position
            as well as the force at the end-effector of the delta manipulator. The method used in making the manipulator
            compliant does not need an explicit force sensor and is convenient to implement. The method is inexpensive
            and works satisfactorily in a human interactive environment which is demonstrated through experiments
            discussed in the paper. The proposed design finds its application in robot-assisted assembly, surface
            finishing, cooperative manipulation, haptics etc.

            We describe the modeling, estimation and control of a quadrotor in 3D environment using the 3DR Pixhawk PX4
            as controller through Robot Operating System(ROS). The paper discusses a method to measure moment of inertia
            of quadrotor about its principal axes to achieve better results in an inexpensive way. We also present the
            trajectory generation and segment optimization of the trajectory commanded to the quadrotor. We describe a
            method of controlling the quadrotor through ROS by providing necessary inputs to the flight controller using
            the built-in firmware.
