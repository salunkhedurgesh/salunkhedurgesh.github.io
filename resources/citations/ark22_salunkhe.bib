abstract="Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution (IKS) to another without meeting a singularity. This property can be analyzed by understanding the inverse kinematic model (IKM) as well as the singularities in the joint space and in the workspace. In this article, we revisit the geometrical interpretation of the IKM with conics. The conditions of getting different conics and their implication on singularities are discussed and the observations regarding the nature of the conics are presented. Further, a sufficient condition for a 3R robot to be binary (i.e. with up to 2 IKS) as well as quaternary (i.e. with up to 4 IKS) is put forth by analyzing the geometrical interpretation of the IKM. The possibility to derive a necessary and sufficient condition is presented too.",
