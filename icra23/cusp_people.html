            Philippe is a Research Director at LS2N, Nantes, France. He started working on cuspidal robots in 1992 and has extensively contributed to this field of research. The term 'cuspidal' was termed by him after the work with El Omri concluded that a cusp in the workspace was a necessary and sufficient condition for robots to change inverse kinematic solutions without crossing a singularity in the joint space. He is currently working on cuspidal robots as a part of project ECARP. The project titled "Efficient and Certified Algorithms for Robot motion Planning" (ECARP) is a joint project
            between the Agence National de Recherché (ANR), France and Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen
            Forschung (FWF), Austria. <br>

            Damien Chablat is a Research Director at LS2N, Nantes, France and is the head of ReV team. He has worked with Philippe Wenger on cuspidality in serial as well as parallel robots. His extension of cuspidality analysis in parallel robots presented a distinct behavior from its serial counterpart. He is currently working on cuspidal robots as a part of project ECARP. The project titled "Efficient and Certified Algorithms for Robot motion Planning" (ECARP) is a joint project
            between the Agence National de Recherché (ANR), France and Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen

            Vincenzo Parenti-Castelli is a professor at University of Bologna. He along with Carlo Innocenti were the first to report an example of 6R cuspidal robot in 1988 at the conference on Advances in Robot Kinematics, 1988. This was a huge feat which went almost unnoticed due to the pre-existing dofma that all robots are non-cuspidal robots. <br>

            Joel W Burdick is a professor at Caltech University, USA. He presented the results on 3R serial robots that could change inverse kinematic solutions without crossing a singularity. His work in USA was in parallel with the findings of Vincenzo Parenti-Castelli in Italy on cuspidal robots. Currently, Professor Burdick focuses on robotics, kinematics, mechanical systems and control. Active research areas include: robotic locomotion, sensor-based motion planning algorithms, multi-fingered robotic manipulation, applied nonlinear control theory, neural prosthetics, and medical applications of robotics. <br>

            Achille Verheye is a Senior Robotics Engineer at Freedom Robotics, USA. He worked with the MICO robot of Kinova robotics, and reported problems related to trajectory planning in the robot. His blog "https://achille0.medium.com/" about cuspidal robots is inspired from the work of Philippe Wenger, and is an informative tour on possible dangers of (ignoring) cuspidality. He has greatly helped in providing the industrial perspective on cuspidal robots, its awareness and deliberate ignorance. He is one of the few non-academic individuals who have contributed to the awareness on cuspidal robots.
